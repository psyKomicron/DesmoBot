## About (long)
DesmoBot Discord bot, written in TypeScript. Obviously it is using the discord.js API.

For now the bot can download attachements embeded in a message, delete messages in a channel. With both commands you can specify on wich channel the bot will be working, and the number of messages to download/delete. In addition to that the `download` command can download a specific type of file (for now only a few types are available).
